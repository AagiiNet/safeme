# Introduction #

SafeMe? is a GML project that allows you to go for example to School or even just quickly to the bathroom without being worried someone will be on your PC. Just click "Make me safe" and it will detect if someone does anything on your pc and will take a snapshot of them (Webcam Needed) and mark the time! It will save a picture and a txt file in a secret folder. It will also be disguised as a crappy video game (icon) and when you open it there will be nothing, so you need to click F8 to see if there has been anyone on. It's free, useful and open source with this license: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/
